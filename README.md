Go library for PACE protocol
============================

This is native library for establishing a secure channel between the terminal
and smart card using PACE protocol.

The library is still work-in-progress and uses hard-coded parameters for
Estonian ID-cards. As such, it should only by used as a reference
implementation. Let me know if there would be interest for using the library
more generally.
